Install Node from here https://nodejs.org, this will be the server environment. Then open up Terminal or Command Line Prompt and make sure you've got the very most recent version of npm by installing it again
        sudo npm install npm -g

Step2:
Create a new folder somewhere and let's create a new Node project. Hit Enter to accept the defaults.
        npm init

Install the additional Node dependencies. Express is for the server, request is for sending out messages and body-parser is to process messages.
        npm install express request body-parser --save
